title: Shorter exception declarations in Ruby
date: 10/09/2012

<a href="http://steveklabnik.com/">Steve Labnik</a> recently wrote a <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-09-09-random-ruby-tricks--class-new">post</a> on Class.new, especially as it relates to a terser syntax for declaring Exception classes.

I use an even terser, albeit more magical syntax.

This is a bit of code that creates a class in ruby, you can find it all over the internet.

Very cool, but I use this only for creating exception classes and so prefer something a bit more explicit. Luckily it is trivial to get what I want from this code.

Viola!

If you wanted to go further, you could modify the code to take multiple arguments, loop through them to create the classes.



note: blog under construction at the moment, please excuse the brokenness of most of it.
