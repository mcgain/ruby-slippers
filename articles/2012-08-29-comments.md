title: Comments
date: 29/08/2012

Like most people, I learnt in university that commenting is essential, every method needed a big block of comments explaining each parameter, what the method does and what is returned. Inside a method, complicated lines needed comments to explain what they did etc.

Fast forward a few years where I am one of 50 developers working on a legacy codebase with 3.5 million lines of code built up over 10 years. I often got asked by newcomers why there were few to no comments in the codebase. My opinion had changed dramatically in just a few short years. I now agreed with others in my company that code comments were unmaintainable. In our experience, existing comments were never updated by the next developer, making them inaccurate at best and dangerous at worst.

I learned to do what many people have recommended, extract the complex code into a new method, using the method's name as the explanation. This is one of the most simple refactorings but it is very effective at reducing comments. Naturally there are still places that require comments, such as deliberate kludges and hacks that require explanation as to why they are there. These comments still risk going out of sync but it is good practice to minimise the amount of these kludges in the code anyway.
